# TCA Data Management Accelerator Documentation Hub
Welcome to the TCA Data Management Accelerator Documentation Hub!

This project is intended as a starting point for TCA researchers to find relevant documentation and best practices for various data types, including guidance on repositories, and submission processes

## Installation
This website is intended to be built and deployed on a web server as a set of HTML files. It is built using a library called mkdocs

mkdocs installation instrunctions can be found here: https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/#installation

Once mkdocs has been installed, the site can be run in development mode using
`mkdocs serve`

To build a new version for deployment run `mkdocs build`. The generated HTML will be found in the `site/` directory

## Guide for contributors
The documentation hub can be expanded according to the official mkdocs documentation, found here: https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/#adding-pages

Diagrams are created using Pencil: https://pencil.evolus.vn/. Note: when creating or modifying diagrams, both the Pencil `.epgz` file and the resulting image should be included in the repository, in the same location. This allows for future maintenance and updates.
