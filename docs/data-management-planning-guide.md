# Data Management Planning Guide
Data management plans (DMPs) are one of the foundations of good research data management (RDM), an international best practice, and increasingly required by institutions and funders, including the Canadian Tri-Agencies as outlined in their Research Data Management Policy. This page is intended to serve as a guide in helping you to prepare to draft a formal data management plan. 

The [Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing System (CIOOS)](https://cioos.ca/) maintains a robust DMP template that we will be building on and expanding for the Transforming Climate Action (TCA) project.

Due to the often sensitive nature of social sciences data the TCA Data Management Accelerator (DMA) will be maintaining two distinct DMP templates, one for non-sensitive data, and one for sensitive data.
   
## General Considerations for DMP Development

!!! note
    Through the process of creating a DMP you will be asked the following questions. Each of these represent key considerations in mapping out the data management requirements for your project.

### Data Requirements
- In addition to the data that you plan to collect through this project, are there any additional data that, if available, would add additional value to your research?

### Project Outputs

- What data will you collect, and what research outputs will you create, derive, link to, acquire and/or record?
- What file formats will your research outputs be in? Will these formats allow for data re-use, sharing and long-term access to the data?

Note: For recommendations and more information please see the [File Formats](data-management-planning-guide/file-formats.md) page.

### Documentation and Metadata

- What documentation will be needed for the research outputs to be read and interpreted correctly in the future? Describe how the documentation is captured or updated consistently throughout the active phase of the project.
- If you are using a data or metadata standard and/or tools to document and describe your data, please list here.
- What processes currently exist to continuously improve data quality (reviews, quality flags, testing, verification, etc) throughout and beyond the active phase of the project? Who has the executive responsibility for the quality of the data?

### Storage and Backup

- What are the anticipated storage requirements throughout the active phase of the project, in terms of storage space (in megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes, etc.) and the length of time you will be storing it?
- How and where will your research outputs be stored and backed up during the active phase of the research project?
??? note
    If safe, secure, redundant near-term data storage represents a gap in your project, it is encouraged that you submit an [Application for the Canadian Digital Research Alliance Rapid Access Service.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeU_BoRk5cEz3AvVLf3e9yZJq-OvcFCQ-mg7p4AWXmUkd5rTw/viewform) For data storage requirements up to 10 terabytes applications are typically processed very quickly. [Additional details available here.](https://www.alliancecan.ca/en/services/advanced-research-computing/accessing-resources/rapid-access-service) If you have any questions please reach out to the data management accelerator at [insert address]
- What collaboration environment and procedures will the research team use to access, modify and contribute data or other research outputs throughout the active phase of the project? How will you organize, name and version-control files in a (shared) directory?
??? note
    If transfer of large data files represents a challenge in your project, the Canadian Digital Research Alliance offers a robust data transfer service for large data files. Combined with the Rapid Access Service documented above, this represents a robust approach to the transfer and storage of small to medium volumes of data. [Additional details available here.](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Globus) If you have any questions please reach out to the data management accelerator at [insert address]

### Preservation

- Where and how long will you deposit or archive your data and supplemental materials (i.e. protocols) for long-term preservation and access at the end of your research project?
!!! note
    Data and metadata may be preserved through submission to a suitable open data repository. Please see the [Data Repository Documentation](data-repository-documentation/introduction.md) for further details.

### Sharing and Reuse

- What research outputs will be shared and in what form? (e.g. raw, processed, analyzed, and model).
- Can your data and research outputs be shared with an open license?
- What steps will be taken to help the research community know that your research outputs exist?
   
### Responsibilities and Resources

- Who will be responsible for managing this project's research outputs during and after the project? Please list the data management-specific tasks for which project contributors will be responsible.
- How will responsibilities for managing data activities be handled if substantive changes happen in the personnel overseeing the project's data, including a change of Principal Investigator?
!!! note
    The TCA Data Management Accelerator is here to support you throughout the data management process, but ultimate responsiblity for the dataset should remain within your team.
- What resources will you require to implement the management of your research outputs? What do you estimate the overall cost for this to be?

### Ethics and Legal Compliance

- Who owns the intellectual property of the research outputs, and how will that person or institution manage legal, ethical, and intellectual property issues?
- Does your project include Indigenous partner involvement, and if so, does it follow the CARE and OCAP Principles?
- If your research project includes sensitive or restricted data, how will you ensure intellectual property rights are protected and that sensitive or restricted data is securely managed and accessible only to approved members of the project, during the active phase of the research?
- If applicable, what strategies will you undertake to address secondary uses of sensitive data?

## Additional DMP Considerations for Sensitive Data
### Sharing and Reuse
- What data cleaning and anonymization procedures will be required to protect the confidentiality of partitipants in your research?
