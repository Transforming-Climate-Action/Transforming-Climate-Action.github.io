# CIOOS

The Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing System ([CIOOS](https://www.cioos.ca/)) is a national network of regional associations that work together to collect, manage, and share ocean data.

> CIOOS engages locally, connects regionally, and coordinates nationally to elevate Canada’s ocean monitoring to the global stage. These partnerships generate information and facilitate place-based solutions to advance our understanding of the ocean. With CIOOS, users can now discover, access, and visualize high-quality data through our online platform. By navigating these vast waters together, CIOOS helps prepare for Canada’s future by unlocking the true potential of our ocean, coasts, and waterways.
