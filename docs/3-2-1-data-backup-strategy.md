# Backup 3-2-1 rule


## Introduction


The 3-2-1 Backup Rule is a trusted strategy for ensuring your data remains secure and recoverable in case of loss or failure. It’s based on three simple principles:

- **3 Total Copies**: Maintain at least three copies of your data—one primary (working) version and two backups.
- **2 Different Storage Types**: Use at least two different types of storage media to minimize the risk of simultaneous failure. For example, combine an external hard drive with a cloud service or use both SSDs and institutional servers.
- **1 Off-Site Copy**: Keep at least one copy in a separate physical location, such as a cloud backup or a secure off-site facility. This adds a vital layer of protection against disasters like fire, theft, or system-wide failure.

Following the 3-2-1 rule significantly improves your chances of data recovery and strengthens overall data resilience.
