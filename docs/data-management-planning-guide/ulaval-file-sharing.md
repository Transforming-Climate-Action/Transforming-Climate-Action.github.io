# File Sharing Platform Hosted at Laval University

TCA researchers can share actively worked-on data using the Laval University file sharing platform. This platform provides reliable file sharing with collaborators within and outside the TCA program. Access the platform at: [TCA file sharing](https://tca-fileshare.s3.valeria.science/tca.html).

The platform is designed for data still being processed or analyzed, not for long-term archiving. Once data is finalized, it should be submitted it to a [permanent repository](docs/data-repository-documentation/introduction.md) such as [SLGO](https://slgo.ca/), [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) or [PANGAEA](https://www.pangaea.de/).
