# Open Data License


### How to choose a license

If you’re not already familiar with open licenses, **try the [Creative Commons License Chooser](https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org)** — a user-friendly tool that helps you select the right license and generates the necessary license text.

The tool walks you through a few simple questions about how you intend to share your data. Based on your responses, it recommends the most appropriate Creative Commons license for your needs. It then provides the licensing text, which you can easily copy and paste into your Data Management Plan or other documentation.
