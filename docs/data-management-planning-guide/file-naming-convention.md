# File Naming Convention

## Introduction

To improve accessibility and organization, itâ€™s recommended to create a clear and consistent file naming convention.
A file naming convention is a structured method for labeling files so that their contents and relationships to other files are easy to understand.
Using consistent naming makes it easier to manage your files and helps collaborators navigate shared folders more efficiently.


Examples:
Files without employing an naming convention:

- test_data_25.csv
- BIO DATA.csv
- Oxygen Optode Calculations-2.xls
- Second_test.txt

Files with a naming convention:

- test_data_sample_20250404.csv
- bio_data_collection_20250404.csv
- oxygen_optode_calc_v02_20250404.xls
- test_run_2_20250404.txt


## How to define your own FNC

There is no single file naming convention (FNC) that fits all projects or datasets. However, you can follow general best practices to design an effective convention that suits your specific needs.
