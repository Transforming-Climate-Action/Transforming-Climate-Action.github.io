# Documentation and Metadata

## Introduction

Metadata are the data needed to understand the data itself. This includes everything from the title and abstract of the data, to the time the sample was collected, to the names of the variables observed. Without sufficient and consistent metadata, it becomes challenging for users to find and compare similar observations. -- <cite>CIOOS</cite>

The process of gathering appropriate documentation and preparing metadata records is typically straightforward. The information required, while critical to future uses of the data, is often fairly obvious and easy to find. Recording metadata is easiest when done during data collection. Metadata incorporates all of the context around the data collection. How and why the data was collected, where the data was and by whome. Details about the individual components of a dataset like units and calibration parameters(if relevant). 

For this reason, questions about metadata plans are incorporated into TCA data management plans. This prompts early thought about what information will need to be collected and provides an opportunity to incorporate it into data collection plans.

## Selecting an Appropriate Metadata Standard

Once you've selected a suitable repository for your data you should check to see if they maintain a metadata standard that would work for your data. Typically most data repositories maintain a metadata standard that ensures a standard level of usability for all data deposited into the repository. 

In the case of very general data repositories it may not be possible or worthwhile for them to adopt a formal metadata standard due to the variety of types of data they accept. In cases like this it is recommended that you investigate the feasibility of using the CIOOS metadata standard for your data. The CIOOS metadata standard is based on internationally accepted standards and is sufficiently general for most types of data. CIOOS also provides tools, documentation, and support to ease the process of developing CIOOS-compliant metadata.

In the case where your chosen data repository doesn't provide a metadata standard and the CIOOS standard isn't suitable for your data, please reach out to your local Data Management Accelerator representative and they will work with you on a modified standard that responds to the need of your data.
