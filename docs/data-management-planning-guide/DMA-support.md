# TCA Data Management Accelerator Support

The TCA Data Management Accelerator is comprised of a federated team, including:

- Institutional data managers working directly at each university involved in TCA
- Support embedded within [two regional associations](https://cioosatlantic.ca/about/) of the CIOOS system: [SLGO](https://slgo.ca/) and [CIOOS Atlantic](https://cioosatlantic.ca/)
- A central TCA Data Management Accelerator team

!!! note
    If there is a data management support that you and your team require, please reach out to the Data Management Accelerator and we are happy to work with you to develop a path forward.

## Institutional Data Managers

Each institution involved in TCA has plans to hire an institutional data manager who will serve as your first point of contact for data management support. Your institutional data manager can offer hands-on support with a number of key data management activities:

- Developing your internal data management workflows, including:
  - File organization and naming
  - Metadata capture plans
  - Access to storage and backup solutions
- Connectivity with the data management accelerator

## CIOOS Support

Data management support staff for the TCA program have been embedded within CIOOS Atlantic, based out of Dalhousie and Memorial, and SLGO, based out of UQAR. Through the collaboration with CIOOS a number of additional supports are available to TCA researchers:

- Training for your team on various data management activities
- Technical support with submission to open data repositories, including:
  - Support with data standardization and conversion to standard data formats
  - Support with metadata standardization and conversion to standard metadata formats
  - Development of automated data pipelines and data management automation tools

## Central TCA Data Management Accelerator Team

In addition to the institutional data management support and the support through CIOOS, there is also a central Data Management Accelerator team. This central team is tasked with:

- The development and maintenance of a robust data policy that aligns with the needs of TCA research
- Coordination of the Data Management Accelerator, facilitation across the partners
- Additional specialized activities that don't fit within CIOOS or the institutional data management support
  - Systems administration support for Canadian Digital Research Alliance infrastructure for data backup and storage
  - Additional activities will be added to this list as needs arise through the life of the project
